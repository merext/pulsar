# Backtesting Latency and Realistic Factors

## Overview
This document outlines the critical latency and realistic factors that are now considered in our backtesting configuration to ensure accurate simulation of real trading conditions.

## üöÄ Critical Latency Factors

### **1. Network Latency Components**
- **Propagation Delay**: 10ms (realistic for good connection)
- **Transmission Delay**: 2ms (data transmission time)
- **Queuing Delay**: 5ms (router queuing delays)
- **Processing Delay**: 3ms (exchange processing time)

### **2. Exchange-Specific Latency**
- **Order Processing**: 1ms (exchange order handling)
- **Order Matching**: 2ms (matching engine latency)
- **Market Data**: 1ms (data dissemination)

### **3. Strategy Latency**
- **Signal Generation**: 1ms (strategy computation)
- **Order Construction**: 1ms (order building)
- **Risk Checks**: 2ms (risk management validation)

### **4. Latency Variation Factors**
- **Latency Spikes**: 1% probability, 5x normal latency
- **Congestion**: 2x latency during market stress
- **Jitter**: 20ms variation in latency

## üèõÔ∏è Market Microstructure Factors

### **1. Order Book Simulation**
- **10 Price Levels**: Realistic order book depth
- **Exponential Size Decay**: Larger orders at better prices
- **Dynamic Spreads**: Spreads vary with market conditions

### **2. Market Maker Behavior**
- **Spread Tightening**: 20% tighter spreads from market makers
- **Inventory Management**: Market makers manage position risk
- **Risk Aversion**: Market makers reduce risk during volatility

### **3. HFT Competition**
- **Latency Advantage**: 1ms advantage for HFTs
- **Order Cancellations**: 30% of HFT orders cancelled
- **Market Impact**: HFT orders affect prices

## üí∞ Realistic Trading Factors

### **1. Order Execution**
- **Fill Rates**: 65% limit order fill probability
- **Partial Fills**: 25% chance, 60% average fill ratio
- **Order Rejections**: 2% rejection rate
- **Queue Position**: Simulates order book position

### **2. Market Impact**
- **Linear Impact Model**: Price impact proportional to order size
- **Impact Decay**: 10% decay rate per time period
- **Size Multiplier**: Larger orders have more impact

### **3. Slippage Modeling**
- **Min Slippage**: 1 tick minimum
- **Max Slippage**: 50 ticks during high volatility
- **Volatility Multiplier**: 2x slippage during stress

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Risk Management Factors

### **1. Circuit Breakers**
- **Consecutive Losses**: Stop after 5 consecutive losses
- **Cooldown Period**: 5 minutes between trading sessions
- **Rate Limiting**: 100 trades per hour maximum

### **2. Position Management**
- **Max Position Size**: $1,000 per trade
- **Max Daily Loss**: $1,000 daily loss limit
- **Max Drawdown**: 20% maximum drawdown

## üìä Performance Tracking

### **1. Comprehensive Metrics**
- Fill rates, slippage, fees, rebates
- Queue position, latency, market impact
- Order rejections and cancellations

### **2. Advanced Analytics**
- Sharpe ratio, Sortino ratio
- Maximum drawdown, Calmar ratio
- Profit factor and win rate

## üéØ Key Benefits

### **1. Realistic Simulation**
- Accounts for real-world trading constraints
- Simulates market microstructure effects
- Models latency and timing accurately

### **2. Bias Prevention**
- Prevents lookahead bias
- Uses point-in-time data
- Handles data gaps appropriately

### **3. Risk Awareness**
- Realistic risk management
- Circuit breakers and position limits
- Comprehensive performance tracking

## üîß Configuration Usage

The enhanced configuration is automatically used when running:
```bash
make test  # Uses realistic backtesting parameters
```

This ensures all backtesting considers these critical factors for accurate strategy evaluation.
