# RSI Strategy Configuration
# Best for: Mean reversion, overbought/oversold conditions

# Core Parameters
period = 10                   # Shorter RSI period for faster signals
overbought = 75.0            # More aggressive overbought threshold
oversold = 25.0              # More aggressive oversold threshold
scale = 1.2                  # Higher signal scaling factor

# Signal Generation
buy_signal = "oversold"       # Buy when RSI crosses below oversold
sell_signal = "overbought"    # Sell when RSI crosses above overbought
signal_threshold = 0.3        # Lower confidence threshold for more signals

# Risk Management
stop_loss_pct = 0.02          # 2% stop loss
take_profit_pct = 0.04        # 4% take profit
max_position_size = 0.1       # Maximum 10% of portfolio per trade
