| **Trade Frequency** | 1-100 trades/day | 1,000-100,000 trades/day |
| **Position Duration** | Hours to days | Seconds to minutes |
| **Profit per Trade** | 0.1-5% | 0.001-0.1% |
| **Risk Management** | Stop-loss orders | Circuit breakers |
| **Data Requirements** | OHLCV bars | Tick-by-tick data |
| **Infrastructure** | Standard servers | Co-located servers |

use strategies::{
    HftUltraFastStrategy,
    HftMarketMakerStrategy,
    Strategy,
};

// Initialize HFT strategies
let mut ultra_fast = HftUltraFastStrategy::new();
let mut market_maker = HftMarketMakerStrategy::new();

// Process tick data (ultra-fast)
for tick in tick_data {
    // Update strategies
    ultra_fast.on_trade(tick.clone()).await;
    market_maker.on_trade(tick.clone()).await;
    
    // Get signals (microsecond-level)
    let ultra_signal = ultra_fast.get_signal(
        tick.price,
        tick.time as f64,
        current_position,
    );
    
    let mm_signal = market_maker.get_signal(
        tick.price,
        tick.time as f64,
        current_position,
